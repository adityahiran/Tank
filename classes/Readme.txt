Tank is a 2D game. This version is just a demonstration of the game and doesn't include all the features. It shows the following behaviour:
1. Key 'f' is used to fire.
2. Key 'q' is used to exit.
3. The "Pause" button is used to pause the tanks.
4. The mouse can be used to select any tank or game objects.
5. The "Reverse" button is used the deflect the tanks from their original path. To produce this effect: click pause -> select a tank -> click reverse -> click play.
